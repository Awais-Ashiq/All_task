# All Projects regarding Image Processing By Muhammad Awais

In this directory i have managed different types of method to do image Processing and numpy. 
Thid directory is managed in a way that i all same type or working can be viewed in same file.
I have done most of the work in jupyter notebook. so you have to open only one notebook to check every detail of particular topic.
Here is the Working tree of my Projects directory
### Flask-Ocr_online
### Numpy and images
### OCR models
### Opencv
### PIL_METADATA

## Numpy and images
 In this directory you can find all the task regarding Image processing using numpy.
 i have done step by step most of the feature that can be used to 
 preprocess images.
 - Like chanel shifting
 - Fliping
 - Rotation
 - Color change
 - Resizing
 - Croping
 ---
#### Work Flow
 this directory have three jupyter notebook files names as 
 - meta_file.ipynb
 - Task_images.ipynb
 - pil_file_ipynb
 all files will open in jupyter notebook and in this file we are checking
 the meta data information of a particular image using Pillow libray
 and subprocess
 in second file which is Task_images we will check all the properties of images.
 and do some usefull operations on image to change its properties.
 this file is also reading meta information but in detail. like pillow 
 can not read detail meta information but subprocess does.
 you need to run the following command to access this code into your system
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/Awais-Ashiq/flask_ocr.git
cd flask_ocr/Numpy\ and\ images
```
 And then run this command
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Above mentioned command will install all the required files to run your application.
