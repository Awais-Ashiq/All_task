# Meta Data and Pillow | Task 2

In this directory i have managed different types of method to do image Processing and numpy. 
Thid directory is managed in a way that i all same type or working can be viewed in same file.
I have done most of the work in jupyter notebook. so you have to open only one notebook to check every detail of particular topic.
Here is the Working tree of my Projects directory
### Meta Data
### Pillow

## Meta Data
 Meta information is like all the bio data that a image contains. we can find the every bit of information related to image
 by using its meta data. it is so powerfull information that agencies use this information to track a anonymous person linked
 to the picture. it can be removed manualy by using some tools. but most of the person do not know much about meta information.
 that is why they cannot track all desired information that are mostly necessary. in python there are different ways we can
 extract information in meta data.

## Pillow
 In this directory you can find all the task regarding Image processing using numpy.
 i have done step by step most of the feature that can be used to 
 preprocess images.
 - Like chanel shifting
 - Fliping
 - Rotation
 - Color change
 - Resizing
 - Croping
 ---
#### Work Flow
 this directory have three jupyter notebook files names as 
 - meta_file.ipynb
 - Task_images.ipynb
 - pil_file_ipynb
 all files will open in jupyter notebook and in this file we are checking
 the meta data information of a particular image using Pillow libray
 and subprocess
 in second file which is Task_images we will check all the properties of images.
 and do some usefull operations on image to change its properties.
 this file is also reading meta information but in detail. like pillow 
 can not read detail meta information but subprocess does.
 you need to run the following command to access this code into your system
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/Awais-Ashiq/flask_ocr.git
cd flask_ocr/Numpy\ and\ images
```
 And then run this command
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Above mentioned command will install all the required files to run your application.
