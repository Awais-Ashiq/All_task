# Opencv-python | Task 2

In this directory i have managed different types of method to do image Processing and numpy. 
Thid directory is managed in a way that i all same type or working can be viewed in same file.
I have done most of the work in jupyter notebook. so you have to open only one notebook to check every detail of particular topic.
Here is the Working tree of my Projects directory

## Opencv-Python
 In this directory you can find all the task regarding Image processing using opencv.
 i have done step by step most of the feature that can be used to 
 preprocess images.
 - Face detection
 - chanell shifting
 - bolean image, masking
 - Draw rectangle, Circle, line on image
 - Like chanel shifting
 - Fliping
 - Rotation
 - Color change
 - Resizing
 - Croping
 - pathlib libray
 - file and folder handling using path
 ---
#### Work Flow
 This Directory have two files.
 - cv2 practice
 - path
 first file will explain most of the functionalities of cv2 class
 library. in this file i have many different manipulations on images 
 using cv2. i have done image fliping, trnasform, crop, rotate, resize
 and many preprocessing techniques. 
 first of all we have face we have face detection in an images using haarcascade
 models we have downlloaded the required file in the repositary you just
 need to clone the repositary in you system by following mentioned command.
 now check for any file you want to use like if you want to check 
 functionalities of opencv then you will open the required notebook file.
 then there are step by step explaination of every concept being used
 by the library.

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/Awais-Ashiq/flask_ocr.git
cd flask_ocr/Opencv
```
 And then run this command
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Above mentioned command will install all the required files to run your application.
